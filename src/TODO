* When a moving entity reaches the destination, have a function called setTilePos
that sets the entity in the middle of the tile.
This is to avoid bugs like when setting speed=1000

* things disappear if they walk towards 0,0

* pixel perfect collision using colour masking. (I NEED to implement this for
tile selection + selection objects) THIS IS HUGE
