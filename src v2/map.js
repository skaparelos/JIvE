/* Strategy pattern like.

Have a Map class with certain methods and an item called this.map
that is set in runtime and is an object of e.g. TiledMap.
The TiledMap should have the basic methods so the rest of the program
can do map.getWidth() and actually call the map.getWidth()
where it actually calls tiledmap.getWidth();
